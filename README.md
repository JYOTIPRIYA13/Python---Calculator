# Python - Calculator

# Abstract:
It is a software of a scientific calculator. It is fully based on Python
language. It can perform various type of operations like Arithmetic
Operations, Trigonometric Operations, Bitwise Operations, Special
Operations like calculating GST, Temperature Conversion,
Permutation and Combination, Solving a quadratic equation, etc.
It is also capable of solving long expressions having the basic
arithmetic operations. It has on user designed module which is
responsible for conversion between the units like length, mass, and
time.

# Fuctionalities:
1. Arithmetic Operations
2. Trigonometric Operations
3. Special Operations
4. Statistics Operations
5. Bitwise Operations
6. Perimeter and Area
7. Extra Functions
8. User-Defined Module
9. Unit Testing


# Limitation and Future Enhancements
There are few limitations:
1. It should include exception handling at some points.
2. It is not in GUI.
3. It doesn’t supports storing the history.
4. It doesn’t have any feature to continue the previous output to the
next operation.

# There are some future enhancements:
1. Some more operations of matrices.
2. Operations of vectors.
3. Calculation of integration and differentiation.
4. Multiple Operations at the same time.


# It consist of 4 python files:
1. Sci_Fi: It is the main file from where the execution begins.
2. Sci_Const: It consist of list of universal constants.
3. Testing: It consist of unit testing functions for all the operations.
4. Len_conv: It consist of length conversion operations.
